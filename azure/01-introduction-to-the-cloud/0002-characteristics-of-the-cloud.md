# Characteristics of the Cloud

## On-Demand Self Service
- No human interaction is needed for resource provisioning
- Resource can be provisioned(created) with a click of a button
- Provisioning is available 24/7

## Broad Network Access
- Resources can be accessed from anywhere using the network
- Ideally high broadband
- No physical access is required at any time

## Resource Pooling
- Physical resources are shared between customers
- The cloud’s backbone (Control Center of the cloud) decides which physical resource to allocate for a customer’s virtual services
- Some advanced cloud services allow for physical resource separation

## Rapid Elasticity
- Resources can be scaled up and down as needed, automatically
- No need to purchase resources for a one-time peak scenario

## Measure Service
- Payment is done only for resources actually used
- Server time / DB storage / Function calls, etc…
- Measurement usually done in high-resolutions
    - Server time by the second
- No need to invest money in non-used resources
