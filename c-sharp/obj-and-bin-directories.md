# Understanding the "obj" and "bin" Directories

In C#, obj and bin are two Directories that are automatically created when you build a project using visual studio or other compilers

# Obj
- stands for object and it contains itermediate files generated during build process.
- It includes object files, metadata, and other build artifacts, those files will be used by the compiler and linker to produce final executable file or library.

# Bin
- stand for binary, it contains final executable file or library that is generated by build process.
- File that you can run or distribute to others.

## Conclusion
- The directory are needed because the C# compiler and linker require intermediate files to be generate during build process to product final output file.
- obj directory contains these intermediate files, which are needed to link and optimize the final executable or library file.
- obj and bin Directories make it easier to manage build artifacts and to separate the build output from the source code files. This separating is important to ensure that the source code is kept separate from the copiled output to avoid accidental modification to the compiled files.
