# Solve

- Why spend time on planning a solution?
  - No reinventing the wheel
  - Write compatible code 
  - Not waste time on implementing sub optimal solutions
  - Not find later that the solutions doesn't work
- Identify what are the context and the scope of the task
  - Find optimal solutions

## Criteria for comparing solutions
- Cost
- Performance
- Forward compatibility
- Simplicity
- Security
- Completeness
- Coding standards and conventions compatibility

## Document Edge cases
