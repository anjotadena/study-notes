# Understand the task
- Invest time in having a deep understanding before coding
  - Less bugs
  - Minimize changes after coding begins
  - Better time management

## How to tell you understand the task
- Basic understanding questions
  - what does the user see?
  - How does each part behave?
  - What interaction is there with other components?
  - what are the edge cases, and how to handle them?

## Document what you know
- Use physical copy/pen/notebooks/e-notes
- Mark/comment key info
